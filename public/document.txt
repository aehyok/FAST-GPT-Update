On an adventure beyond the continent of Moebius, a legacy is accidentally triggered. A portal hidden in space appears, and the adventurers are transported through an ancient portal to a completely unknown planet, where there are still traces of civilisation. But bizarrely, the entire planet has no connection to Mobius or even Ocean of Soul, as if it existed in another dimension, which is certainly an astonishing discovery.
Adventurers from Moebius then founded a committee to undertake a massive exploration of the realm. But the exploration was not a satisfactory one, with most of the space being filled with chaotic energies, causing serious damage to the exploration teams. And as the portal energy faded, it caused the material replenishment of the Committee to a stagnant halt.
However, in the meantime, the Committee has still acquired a number of independent planets with intact ecology that can support life. After saving a portion of the planets with special significance, the remaining planets will be sold to adventuring teams with exceptional contributions.
Such planets, with their various ecological capabilities to support life, are undoubtedly an invaluable asset for adventurous teams, being extremely secretive and safe and contains valuable resources that are not possible to obtain on Moebius. The only way to get to it is to get the exact coordinates through a portal. In time, the possession of the PLANET coordinates, issued by the Committee, became a status symbol for the adventuring team â€” a symbol of a glorious future.
